# Welcome
For this notebook, my objective is to apply the knowledge I acquired in building convolutional neural networks. 
I chose the EuroSAT dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanholbrook/eurosat). 

This dataset has a total of 27,000 labeled images taken by the Sentinel-2 satellite. The labels represent the land use of each of the image. 

The notebook is divided into the following sections: 

1. Importing libraries
2. Fetching and Exploring the data
3. Building the input pipeline (including preprocessing)
4. Optimising data access 
5. Augmenting the data 
6. Building, - training and testing the CNN model -
7. What  <font color = "red">**SURPRISED ME!!** </font> ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®
